     <h2>Background</h2>
<p>During most of the British colonial period,
     slavery existed in all the colonies. 
     People enslaved in the North typically worked as house servants, artisans, laborers and craftsmen, 
     with the greater number in cities. Many men worked on the docks and in shipping. 
     In 1703, more than 42 percent of New York City households held enslaved people in bondage, 
     the second-highest proportion of any city in the colonies, 
     behind only Charleston, South Carolina.[11] Enslaved people were also used as agricultural workers in farm communities, 
     especially in the South, 
     but also in upstate New York and Long Island, 
     Connecticut, and New Jersey. By 1770, 
     there were 397,924 blacks out of a population of 2.17 million 
     in what would soon become the United States. 
     The slaves of the colonial era were 
     unevenly distributed: 14,867 lived in New England, 
     where they were three percent of the population; 34,679 lived in the mid-Atlantic colonies, where they were six percent of the population; and 347,378 in the five Southern Colonies, where they were 31 percent of the population.[12]

<h2>Slavery in the American Revolution and early republic
</h2>
<p>As historian Christopher L. Brown put it, slavery "had never been on the agenda in a serious way before", but the American Revolution "forced it to be a public question from there forward".[17][18]
    After the new country's independence was secure, slavery was a topic of contention at the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Many of Founding Fathers of the United States were plantation owners who owned large numbers of enslaved laborers; the original Constitution preserved their right to own slaves, and they further gained a political advantage in owning slaves. Although the enslaved of the early Republic were considered sentient property, were not permitted to vote, and had no rights to speak of, they were to be enumerated in population censuses and counted as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of representation in the national legislature, the U.S. Congress.

 <h2>Slaves and free blacks who supported the Continental Army
</h2> 
   <p>The rebels began to offer freedom as an incentive to motivate slaves to fight on their side. Washington authorized slaves to be freed who fought with the American Continental Army. Rhode Island started enlisting slaves in 1778, and promised compensation to owners whose slaves enlisted and survived to gain freedom.[20][21] During the course of the war, about one-fifth of the Northern army was black.[22] In 1781, Baron Closen, a German officer in the French Royal Deux-Ponts Regiment at the Battle of Yorktown, estimated the American army to be about one-quarter black.[23] These men included both former slaves and free-born blacks. Thousands of free blacks in the Northern states fought in the state militias and Continental Army. In the South, both sides offered freedom to slaves who would perform military service. Roughly 20,000 slaves fought in the American Revolution.[19][24][25][26][27]
